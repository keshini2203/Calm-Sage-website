            <p>I want you to know that I see your strength, even when the weight of depression tries to hold you down. 
            You are not alone in this battle, and I am here to support you every step of the way. 
            Remember, you are so much more than your struggles, and brighter days are ahead. 
            Keep pushing forward, for each small step you take is a triumph, and your journey 
            towards healing is a testament to your resilience. Together, we can navigate the storm 
            and find the sunshine waiting on the other side. You've got this</p>

            <h4>Stressed</h4>
            <p>Stress is just a temporary cloud that can't dim the brightness of your spirit. 
            Keep your head high, breathe deeply, and remember that every challenge you face 
            is an opportunity for growth. You've got the strength to weather the storm and 
            find the sunshine on the other side. Keep moving forward, and brighter days are 
            on their way.</p>

            <h4>Anxious</h4>
            <p>I want you to know that your anxiety does not define you. 
            It's a temporary storm that will pass, and you are stronger than you think. 
            Embrace each challenge as an opportunity for growth, and remember that you 
            have the power to rewrite your story. Your resilience is your greatest asset,
            and I believe in your ability to conquer your fears and find peace within yourself. 
            Keep taking one step at a time, and before you know it, you'll look back and see 
            just how far you've come. You've got this!</p>

            <h4>Healing</h4>
            <p>Your journey of healing is a testament to your resilience and strength. 
            Each day you move forward, no matter how small the steps may seem, you are 
            making progress. Embrace the process, be gentle with yourself, and know that 
            healing is not linear. You are on the path to a brighter, healthier future, 
            and with each sunrise, you are one step closer to your best self. Keep going, 
            and remember, your strength is your greatest healer.</p>

            <h4>Moody</h4>
            <p>Life is a beautiful rollercoaster with its ups and downs. 
            Your moods are just a part of that ride. Embrace each moment, 
            whether it's high or low, for they all contribute to the vibrant 
            tapestry of your life. Keep your chin up, and know that your mood 
            is just a passing cloud in the vast sky of your potential. 
            Tomorrow is a new day, and with it, a chance for a brighter outlook.</p>
